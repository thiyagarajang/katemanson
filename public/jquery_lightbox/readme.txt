How to apply options?

	There are two methods, one is through the link form, and the other is through the constructor.
	Use the below examples to derive how it is used to hide the linkback, and translate "Image" to "Photo".
	
	Link method:
		<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery_lightbox/js/jquery.lightbox.packed.js?show_linkback=false&amp;text.image=Photo"></script>
		
	Constructor method:
		<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery_lightbox/js/jquery.lightbox.packed.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript">$(function(){
			$.Lightbox.construct({
				show_linkback:	false,
				text: {
					image:		'Photo'
				}
			});
		});</script>
